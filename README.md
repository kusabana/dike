source engine plugin to detect view angle manipulation
</div>

#
> **Warning**\
Dike is by no means "production-ready" as is, and serves as a proof-of-concept to the method of detection, not a finished product.\
There are still alot of edge cases to account for, like acceleration or joystick.
### introduction

Dike is a small proof of concept serverside anticheat for games built on the Source Engine that uses a novel method of detecting view angle manipulation (aimbot). This is accomplished by intercepting and analyzing player commands, and comparing them to previous snapshots to detect any unusual or suspicious changes in angle.
